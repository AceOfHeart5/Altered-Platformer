Nothing is this list is true forever. This is just where we are right now.

TO DO:
re-make some simple enemies to prepare for testing hit/hurt boxes
Re-implement hit/hurt boxes using new o_state system.
Rework states/actions: Make actor states objects that can be added to new actors (in progress, huge task)
Update Doors to use new o_state
Update Elevators to use new o_state or o_scene? Need to figure out which makes more sense.
Air attacks
Blocking (shield)

DONE:

move variables from o_global to new more specific objects if possible
Remove all camera-related elements from o_global and put them in o_camera
Rework Textboxes
Add scene objects
Add "continue" functionality to text boxes (accomplished through scene objects instead)
add "typing" effect to text boxes (look at draw event, it's not reading limits right)
Make a complete scene to test what we've added. (example dialogue scene added)
Narrative Screen, rework to use text boxes
