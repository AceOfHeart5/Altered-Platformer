Nothing is this list is true forever. This is just where we are right now.

TO DO: 
hitboxes are too screwy, rework so all sounds are in effects and move everything from hitbox_hurt_actor script to hitbox step events.
ladder hurt isn't working
Remake Current Enemies
make another spawn object, campfire??
Air attacks
Blocking (shield)
add test boss with intro sequence
bug, it is possible to break controls through remapping

DONE:
create projectile/moving hitboxes
make actcon naming consistent. Remove act_controller and things like that, replace with actcon
Bug, enemies falling off screen causes input bug.
Make first AI object "wander" (could be a huge project.....)(LOL it was actually easy)
Allow pause menu to interrupt and end most transitions
Remove player specific sprite settings in transitions
replace references to o_player with global.player
re-add crouch attack (took like an hour, state system seems solid)
Create Elevator as a spawn object using our plan for spawn/save point objects.
Update Elevators to use new o_state or o_scene? Need to figure out which makes more sense.
Rework states/actions: Make actor states objects that can be added to new actors (in progress, huge task)
Update Doors to use new o_state
(will make as needed) create a variety of scene objects that allow us to transition between rooms however we want.
create a test transition object that when called from the initializer, fades screen to blue, changes rooms, then fades from red
make all actor sprite origins bottom center ( I think we'll leave effects as center center)
Re-implement hit/hurt boxes using new o_state system. (still needs tweaking, but it's done for now)
re-make some simple enemies to prepare for testing hit/hurt boxes
move variables from o_global to new more specific objects if possible
Remove all camera-related elements from o_global and put them in o_camera
Rework Textboxes
Add scene objects
Add "continue" functionality to text boxes (accomplished through scene objects instead)
add "typing" effect to text boxes (look at draw event, it's not reading limits right)
Make a complete scene to test what we've added. (example dialogue scene added)
Narrative Screen, rework to use text boxes

REMOVED:

Between level score card (maybe we should do this after all?)
