Yosi's explanation of using arrays as references for variables

Something that yields this kind of behavior:
myGlobalVar = 0;
myLocalVar = myGlobalVar; // as a reference
myLocalVar = 5;
print(myGlobalVar); // will print 5
Hopefully that's a clear enough explanation

You should be able to use arrays to do this

Can you elaborate? I don't understand what you mean.

Let me do a quick test first actually

ok ty
If that doesn't work I'm pretty sure I can just do some jank with enumerators.

gml_pragma("global","array_test()");

var array = [5];

var other_array = array;

array[@0] = 10;

show_message(other_array[0]); //10

var array = [5];

var other_array = array;

array[0] = 10;

show_message(other_array[0]); //5
Oh wait, I think this is backwards
Nevermind, it still works even if you swap it
So if you use the [@ ] accessor when changing the contents of the array, then it will change the source array instead of making a copy

ok interesting

Obviously it's kind of a hack but it's pretty simple to use so :shrug:
