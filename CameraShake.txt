We need to collect our thoughts on screen shake.
First, I think the way we want to do screen shake is to have x and y offset values for the camera that oscillate between a min and max value that decreases each step. Each step will not necessarily be one frame. I'm thinking more like 2-3 frames. But we'll see. So to clarify, this is what our x offsets might look like each step:

10
-9
8
-7
6
-5
4
-3
2
-1
