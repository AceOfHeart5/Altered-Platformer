So here's the issue with "states". Damn near every moving object in the game will have states. And a lot of them are going to have states that are nearly identical. For example: walking. We need to create a system that allows us to create one "walking" state, and reuse it for different characters. 

This wouldn't be too difficult EXCEPT that all the different characters will be capable of different actions, like jumping, crouching, attacking, blocking, whatever. Right now the player's idle state code has a bunch of player unique state changes for things like jumping, moving, whatever. We need to setup states so that we can be flexible with what states a state can change to. 

So let's try to clarify some things about this problem to help us solve it. First off, we can't have states change state. There can be nothing like:

if (jump_pressed) set_state(air_up);

because perhaps we don't need a character to jump. The states have to not link. However, we still need a way to determine when a character will change from one state to another. 

Often a state will move a character a certain vertical and horizontal distance. Then, often there may be conditions that, if true, require a state change. A perfect example is walking off a cliff (in the walking state moving to standing on nothing). 

In other instances, a button press means the state could be completely ignored. If the jump button is pressed while in the walking state, there is no need to check the rest of the code since the character is no longer "walking". 

Furthermore, there are some states that are always checked for, like getting hurt. How do we incorporate those?

I also want to bring up a problem with my current state code that makes it more bloated than I think it needs to be. When the player enters a new state, the code also has to run checks for the new state. So let's say the player jumps while right under a wall. The "walking" state code has to check for ceilings, and put the character in the air_dn state if he hits any. That's kind of silly since that's something the air_up should be doing. Our new solution should solve this silly issue so one state is checking for a bunch of stuff it shouldn't have to. 

So let's lay down some ideas that might fix all this:

What if we had a state object. A state object would contain:

1. A list of "before" triggers that change the state
2. The state code itself which determines how the character moves/changes.
3. A list of "after" triggers that change the state

The triggers would most likely be all checks for input like jumping and attacking. I suppose triggers could do stuff to the character like move them or change sprites, but I'm not going to worry too much about those details. They key point is the before triggers would skip the state code. Perfect example: pressing the jump button is a before trigger for the walking state. Once the jump button is pressed, don't bother executing the walking code, execute the air_up code. 

After triggers would let the state code finish, but then check to see if we are still in that state. For example, if the character walks off of a surface during the walk state, we need an after trigger to check for that, and then put the character in the air_dn state. 

Maybe I shouldn't call these "triggers". Because they aren't really triggers, they're more like checks. Maybe I should just called them checks??

Perhaps before checks shouldn't automatically skip the state code. Looking back at the example of jumping, we actually still need to check state code, just not the walking state code. In that example, the state code would change to air_up, and that should be the code that runs to check movement. This solves our problem we mentioned earlier about states having to make checks that other states should be making. 

So how can we actually change states though? We may have to name each state created for each character, and specifically refer to the in the checks we add. Also it's not clear right now if checks should be scripts or objects or what. 

Here's a rough idea of what an actors run code would look like if we implemented this:

for (i = 0; i < before_checks.size(); i++) {
	execute_script(before_checks[i]);
	// Here we'll assume the check code changes states?
}

execute_script(current_state.state_script);

for (i = 0; i < after_checks.size(); i++) {
	execute_script(after_checks[i]);
}

If we decide that checks need to be objects, then it would just look like:
execute_script(before_checks[i].script);
But I don't think checks need any variables that can't be easily made in a script? Also we need to remember to break the check loops if we change states since the checks will not be the same for each state.

So an example state made in an actor might be something like:

v_myact_state_idle = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);

scr_state_addbeforecheck(run, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addbeforecheck(jump, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addbeforecheck(attack, v_myact_state_idle);

Wait hold on, we've just uncovered a problem. In theory the before check "jump" would be able to change the actor state to an air_up state. But it can't do that since it doesn't exist yet right? So I guess we'd have to make all the states before we made the checks.

v_myact_state_idle = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_airup = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_airdn = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_run = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_attack = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);

A quick note about the above code. I think we're just going to have to know from experience that if we want the character to be able to jump, we need to add an air_up and air_dn state. There are likely going to be dozens of other scenarios like that. 

So we've made our states. This actor should be able to idle, run, jump, and attack (on the ground). So now we should be able to add checks like this:

scr_state_addbeforecheck(run, v_myact_state_idle);

But how does this link to the run state? Maybe our add check script needs to be something like:

scr_state_addbeforecheck(stateAddTo, triggerScript, stateChangeTo);

so the run check would look like: 
scr_state_addbeforecheck(v_myact_state_idle, run, v_myact_state_run);
where state_idle is the state we're adding the check to, run is a script that determines if the actor has started running, and state_run is the state we'll change to if run returns true.

So I guess this means that check scripts will only ever return true or false?? And also I think this mean that checks can only change to one state. That's probably a more elegant way to do it anyway since it keeps scripts smaller and with clearer intention. However this is 3 pieces of important data we're storing in a "check". I don't think checks can just be scripts, they'll have to be objects with variables. Not very many, but vars no less. The script we used above had 3 variables, but one of those was the state we were adding the check to. So the check object really only has two variables: script, and state to change to. I guess this is our check object:

o_check
v_check_script = script;
v_check_tostate = o_state;

I think that works. So we'll have o_state which contains a list of before checks, a list of after checks, and the actual state script. It will also need to have data about sprite animation. Then we also have o_check which contain an o_state as the state to change to, and a script that returns true or false if the conditions to change states are met. Let's try making our character again. 

(interrupted myself while typing)

Wait, do we really need before and after checks? I think I'm over complicating it. I can't think of a reason you would need to change states within a frame. We should be able to execute state code, always, and then check to see if the state has changed for the next frame. All checks are done after state code, so we'll just have "checks". Take 2:

// add states
v_myact_state_idle = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_airup = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_airdn = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_run = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);
v_myact_state_attack = instance_create_layer(o_state, enemies);

// assign states scripts
scr_state_setscript(v_myact_state_idle, scr_state_run);
scr_state_setscript(v_myact_state_airup, scr_state_run);
scr_state_setscript(v_myact_state_airdn, scr_state_run);
scr_state_setscript(v_myact_state_run, scr_state_run);
scr_state_setscript(v_myact_state_attack, scr_state_run);

// add checks
// idle
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_idle, scr_statecheck_run, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_idle, scr_statecheck_jump, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_idle, scr_statecheck_attack, v_myact_state_attack);

// run
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_run, scr_statecheck_idle, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_run, scr_statecheck_jump, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_run, scr_statecheck_attack, v_myact_state_attack);

// airup
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_airup, scr_statecheck_airdn, v_myact_state_airdn);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_airup, scr_statecheck_run, v_myact_state_run); // technically possible

// airdn
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_airdn, scr_statecheck_idle, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_airdn, scr_statecheck_run, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addcheck(v_myact_state_airdn, scr_statecheck_attack, v_myact_state_attack); // requires frame perfect input

Ok... that seems pretty good. However, I'm noticing a pattern, every check script matches with the same state. I had initially thought I would need different checks for the same state. Do I? Are there situations where the same state would need different conditions to be true to enter it? Even if that was true, what I'm thinking is we can just include check scripts in the state objects themselves, and the states will hold a list of states they can change to. So instead of adding a bunch of checks our code would look like:

//connect states
scr_state_addconnect(v_state_gettingConnection, v_state_connectedto);

I don't really know how to determine this, so let's just assume we can get away with it since it's less work ;)
So after establishing our states, the connections would look like:

//idle
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_attack);

//run
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_attack);

//airup
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airup, v_myact_state_airdn);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airup, v_myact_state_run); // technically possible

//airdn
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_attack); //requires frame perfect input

//attack
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_attack, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_attack, v_myact_state_run);

I think we're getting somewhere. We need to address something we may have done wrong earlier, and that is when to do checks for state changes and when to do state code. First let's review how input and frames interact. Basically, all inputs cause a change on the next frame. You press the attack button on frame 100, then on frame 101 the character will be in the first frame of their attack animation. I don't know exactly how game maker handles update code relative to the actual rendering loop, but I think it's ok to think of the logic happening between frames (even though I know that's wrong). 

If we want our attack to show up on frame 101, our code will have to execute checks for state changes, change the state if necessary, then execute the state code. If we do the check afterwards, then the character will still show whatever was executed for idle/run on frame 101, but somehow they'd technically be in the attack state since the check and change has happened. 

Let's review what we've designed (haven't written any code yet lol). Our new state system will use o_state objects. It contains the following variables:

v_state_checkscript; // a script that determines if the actor can enter this state
v_state_connections; // a list of other o_state objects that this state can change to
v_state_script; // the script code the actor executes when in this state

Actors will now have slightly different variables which to maintain states
v_act_curstate; // the state the actor is currently in
v_act_states; // a list of states the actor can be in

To setup actor states, the code looks like this:

// make all states (the state objects can be children of a parent state object)
v_myact_state_idle = instance_create_layer(o_state_idle, enemies);
v_myact_state_airup = instance_create_layer(o_state_airup, enemies);
v_myact_state_airdn = instance_create_layer(o_state_airdn, enemies);
v_myact_state_run = instance_create_layer(o_state_run, enemies);
v_myact_state_attack = instance_create_layer(o_state_attack, enemies);

// assign connections
//idle
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_idle, v_myact_state_attack);

//run
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_airup);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_run, v_myact_state_attack);

//airup
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airup, v_myact_state_airdn);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airup, v_myact_state_run); // technically possible

//airdn
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_run);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_airdn, v_myact_state_attack); //requires frame perfect input

//attack
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_attack, v_myact_state_idle);
scr_state_addconnect(v_myact_state_attack, v_myact_state_run);


And the main step event code will look like this:

// check if state has changed
for (i = 0; i < ds_list_size(v_act_curstate.v_state_connections); i++) {
	var checkstate = ds_list_element_at(v_act_curstate.v_state_connections, i); // this is a state object
	if (script_execute(checkstate.v_state_checkscript)) {
		i = ds_list_size(v_act_curstate.v_state_connections); // break loop
		v_act_curstate = checkstate;
	}
}

// then run state script
script_execute(v_act_curstate.v_state_script);



I think that just about does it.
